Originally launched for iOS in October 2010,
 Instagram rapidly gained popularity,
  with one million registered users in two months,
   10 million in a year, and 1 billion as of June 2018.
    The Android version was released in April 2012, 
## Usage
npm start
followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012,
 a Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016.
  As of October 2015, over 40 billion photos had been uploaded. Although praised for its influence,
   Instagram has been the subject of criticism, most notably for policy and interface changes, allegations of censorship,
    and illegal or improper content uploaded by users.
